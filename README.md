# Overview

I created a simple web browser as a steping stone to create a much mroe powerful one in the future. THis project is simply to get my feet wet and teach me what I need to learn to get to my goal.

I want to eventually create a powerful and fast open source browser not based on chromium so data management can be done openly.

Using Visual Studio I created a windows forms application running .NET 6.0

I used the webbrowser class and the easytabs library from NuGet.

# Future Work

* Decide which language I want to write the proper browser in.
* Find and incorperate open source javascript engine.
* Find and incorperate html rendering engine.
* Find out about XML
* Possibly make a basic browser with electron and move on from there.
